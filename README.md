# GML Events
A collection of scripts implementing C#-style events in GML.

## How to use
### Event()
To create a new event, use `new Event()`. This constructs a struct containing methods for adding event functions to the event, removing event functions from the event, triggering the event, deleting the event, and clearing the event. The struct also contains methods beginning with `__`, these are *private* methods and **should not** be called from outside the struct.
